# Welcome to My GitHub!

![Hello, World!]

Hi there! I'm Binaryx01, your friendly neighborhood coder with a passion for ASP.NET Core and Game Development. If you’re here, it’s either because you’re interested in my code, or you’re lost and need directions to the nearest coffee shop. Either way, welcome!


## 🛠️ My Toolkit

- **Languages**: C#, JavaScript, TypeScript (Fluent in CoffeeScript and Sarcasm)
- **Frameworks**: ASP.NET Core, Unity (Not the Unity you see in a cheesy sci-fi movie)
- **Tools**: Visual Studio, Git, Docker (for when you need your code in a tiny, portable container)


## 🤝 Let’s Connect!

Feel free to browse my repositories, star the ones you like, and maybe leave a comment or two. And remember, every star helps a squirrel get its wings!

Happy Coding! 🚀
